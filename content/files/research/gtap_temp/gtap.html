<h1>The GTAP model implemented in GAMS</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a GAMS implementation of the GTAP model.  I know that the GTAP model
is already implemented in GAMS by a sample model in Tom Rutherford's GTAPinGAMS.
However, his model differs from the original GTAP model in several ways.  The
major difference is that
<ul>
 <li> The original GTAP model assumes CDE utility function for private
      consumption, but Rutherford's model assumes Cobb-Douglas utility function.
 <li> The original GTAP model assumes variable investment, but he assumes
      constant investment.
</ul>

<p>With respect to the above two points, my model follows the original GTAP
model.

<p><b>[Note]</b>
<br>Although I tried to replicate the original GTAP model as closely as
possible, the model in my program differs from the original model.  It is
because the GTAP model uses Divisia type index.  Since Divisia type index cannot
be represented in the level form, my model uses Tornqvist index, which is a
discrete approximation to a continuous Divisia index, instead of it.  This makes
my model differ from the original GTAP model.
